Provides a facility to represent and render a two-dimensional simulation. This package is intended to allow objects
from a program's engine to act as entities within a two-dimensional simulated world. Each object has a position in the
world in terms of X and Y coordinates as well as a layer (used to distinguish rendering order between objects which
overlap and, in this way, similar to a Z coordinate). The Cosm engine provides a {@link Component} with which the
contents of a {@link Cosm} can be displayed.
