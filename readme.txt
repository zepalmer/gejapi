GEJAPI: General Extensions for the Java API
-------------------------------------------

This library contains a large and badly arranged miscellany of all of the
little tools that I have needed during the creation of a program but have not
been able to find, that I have written to replace components of the JDK API
because I didn't like the way the JDK API's tools worked, or that I have
written for the sake of my own entertainment and interest.  Some of this
material I wrote in order to better learn a particular programming concept and
thus may not have been finished; other parts of this material are either badly
designed, buggy, or simply embarrassing.  In other words, use at your own risk.

The conents of this library are released under the GNU General Public License
Version 3 (a copy of which should be located in the same directory as this
notice as GPLv3.txt).  I am not a lawyer or otherwise so trained, but it is
my understanding that, if any or all of this source is included in any
software, the following statements are true:

    1. Your software must be licensed under the GPL Version 3.

    2. Even if you do not use all of the source provided herein (and it is my
       suspicion that you won't), you are obligated to make available to the
       people to whom you distribute your software the entirety of its source
       code as specified in the GPL Version 3.

In order to simplify the source code distribution terms of the license, you may
choose to store the following notice in a prominent location in any distribution
of the binary form of this library:

    Source code for the GEJAPI library is available at the project's GitHub
    repository.  To locate that repository, please view the following website:
    http://www.github.com/zepalmer/gejapi

That said, I hope you get some use out of this ramshackle collection of odds
and ends.

Regards,

Zachary Palmer
